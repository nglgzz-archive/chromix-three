# Chromix Three

This project provides external JS access to Chrome's internal API.
It's heavily inspired by `chromix-too`, the main differences are that
`chromix-three` doesn't provide shell support, but it's better suited
for being used within JavaScript.

## How does it work?

At the moment you need to install the `chromix-too` chrome extension and run
the `chromix-too-server`. You can check the getting start guide here: https://github.com/smblott-github/chromix-too.
